/* Constants
Constants are similar to variables except that they cannot be changed or undefined after they've been defined.
Begin the name of your constant with a letter or an underscore.
To create a constant, use the define() function:
define(name, value, case-insensitive)
Parameters:
name: Specifies the name of the constant;
value: Specifies the value of the constant;
case-insensitive: Specifies whether the constant name should be case-insensitive. Default is false;
 */
// The example below creates a constant with a case-sensitive name:
define("MSG", "Hello");
echo MSG;
// The example below creates a constant with a case-insensitive name:
define("MSG2", " World!", true);
echo msg2;
?>
